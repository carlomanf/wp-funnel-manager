Organises content into multi-step funnels.

== Description ==

Have you ever needed to arrange your content in a multi-step sequence? Then WP Funnel Manager is what you need!

WP Funnel Manager works great for sales funnels, but it's also perfect for instruction manuals, online courses, or any kind of content that users must move through sequentially.

== Installation ==

This section describes how to install the plugin and get it working.

1. Upload the plugin files to the `/wp-content/plugins/wp-funnel-manager` directory, or install the plugin through the WordPress plugins screen directly.
1. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' screen in WordPress
1. Use the Funnels screen in WordPress to start building your funnels

== How to Use This Plugin ==

After installation, you will find a Funnels screen in WordPress. Click on Add New to start your first funnel. You will find the familiar editing screen to create the first step of your funnel.

To add more steps to your funnel, visit the funnel in the Funnels screen and click on Edit Steps. Then, click on Add New to add a new step to this funnel. Again, use the familiar editing screen to add content to this step.

Repeat this process for each step of the funnel. Make sure you use the WordPress menu order feature to arrange the steps of your funnel in the correct order.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I delete the first step of my funnel without deleting the whole funnel? =
